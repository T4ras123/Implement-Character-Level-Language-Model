# Implementation of makemore repo for learning purpoces

My implementation of [makemore](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore) ropository to learn LLMs

Already implemented:

- **Bigram** model with 1 charecter of context size and negative log-likelihood loss of ~2.7

- **Linear neural network model** with the same loss and result as a bigram, as the underlying processes are the same, but in the NN probabilities are learnt not counted

- **MLP** - multi-level preceptron with 27 x 10 embeding space and a context size of 6
